      "The use of Team'Doc in an emergency department opens up prospects for a clear improvement in collaboration within the team and the hospital. The planned deployment of personalized transmission forms for our department will allow us to optimize our organization and will save us time. Current events (cyber attacks, computer breakdowns, etc.) show us that we must change our habits and turn to secure tools. Team'doc meets all these needs",

      "Team'doc improves the daily life of our teams in many ways: communication is made easier and we save precious time. Why did you choose Team Doc instead of other non-secure messaging applications? First of all, Team'doc allows us to secure the exchanges relative to the companies we support and to allow the confidentiality of the data, whether it is the company's own data or data related to clinical studies. But Team'doc also allows to reduce task interruptions thanks to the display of availability and guarantees the quality of life at work by allowing the disconnection of personnel outside their working hours. Having a mixed application/web display also provides a significant comfort of use.",
