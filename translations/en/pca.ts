The increase in terms of computer disasters (hacking, DataCenter fire, network outage ...) and general computer unavailability, requires to question the choice of a solution allowing the continuation of care activity. The implementation of a tool such as Team'Doc capable of responding to a cyber attack that puts the IS out of service is today essential for health establishments",

To do this, it is necessary for professionals to take ownership of the tool and to think about what patient information is useful if the IS is unavailable. The applications of such a tool, if it is widely deployed, can even be pushed towards other functional needs (downgraded mode via the transmission modules, request for advice, IS training space allowing newcomers to be directed towards training courses in video format).",
