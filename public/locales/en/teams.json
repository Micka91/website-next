He set up a team of application development experts to design the application and a scientific committee representing the main medical and paramedical disciplines to ensure that the solution meets the needs of healthcare professionals.",

    "p1": "« The idea of Team'Doc was born at the beginning of my internship. ",
    "p2": "I was looking for an application to simplify medical transmissions and improve communication with my team: today we lose time and information arrives by many different means of communication.",
    "p3": "I often say « well-informed caregivers are better cared for patients ». ",
    "p4": "I therefore created Team'Doc to simplify the daily life of all the carers, whether they work in hospitals, clinics, towns, nursing homes, etc. The objective was clear: it wasn't a question of developing yet another application, but of offering a unique work tool to enable healthcare professionals to devote themselves to their activity: caring. ",
    "p5": "My second demand was about data security.",
    "p6": "Today we use tools that do not comply with the regulations concerning health data. This is no longer acceptable! Team'Doc will always protect its users' data. »"
